the pay will be about the same but i don't believe that i will enjoy it at much as the job that i just started, should i purposefully have a borderline interview vs a stellar one?

if nato collapsed then suddenly all the countries that are your friends and allies will suddenly find that they have minority russian populations like crimea does, or like the sudetenland and the danzig corridor did in wwii.

modern conservatives believe in free markets but do not uphold the liberal values... for example, classical liberalism upholds that all men are equal and it is not the job of the government to dictate who someone is allowed to marry.
i suppose his parents could have bought him in and then paid for all of his grades while somehow preventing anyone from finding out about a serious disability, but occam's razor suggests that he's probably capable of reading at an adult level.
i pray that he sticks with it.
well i hope that it is a challenge.
--------- there is a growing trend in the "manosphere" (if i'm permitted to say that without coming across as a dirty ess-jay-dubya) that marriage is a fundamentally broken contract that seeks to ensnare the hard-earned money of hapless men everywhere when women decide they're unhappy.
