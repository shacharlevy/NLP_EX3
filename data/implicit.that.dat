i think mine is easy...
if they refuse, i would strongly suggest you *bribe* them.
since they're enablers, i doubt it would do any good anyways.
i pretend it wasn't me , and wonder why i had to put the straw so deep .
how the times have changed since then and that it's easier to come out when you know it'll be taken seriously and nobody will give you shit for it.
i know it's an upgrade, but it's not like this is a move that puts the dodgers into sudden-ws contenders territory
i bet all women who've been assaulted or harassed look back and think that they were stupid, they did something wrong, they could have fixed it.
in my case my friend was happy about it - i mean he liked me and knew i wasn't a gamey type that was going to be an asshole with his sis.
even though we always seem to be fucking awesome then instantly fucking horrible, i do believe we will get back to playing like the best in the east.
i've gotten shit for saying it was regulated and saying it's mechanical.
i think i'm fortunate enough to know good sources so my supply is always at least decent, but for other people: not great.
now, i don't live in the us, but i think i can conjecture that co-ed parties, with athletes and a lot of booze, typically do not revolve around philosophical discussions or math problems.
i really hope it's ai that *learns* from the way you fight and trains with you so something like this is possible.
i think sometimes it's the best medicine.
this is don saying he wants conrad to treat him like an equal, not like a protégé.
yeah, i get it, you're a gay rights website, but that doesn't mean you have to bombard me with softcore pornography.
i want to say it was a lighter ale as well.
i wish i could pin a today widget to the homescreen.
i knew this would be the top comment
if no one says anything then hopefully that just means you have a bunch of ungrateful people.
rule 2 reads:  rule 2 also reads:  op admitted this isn't trashy, so we have an admission of guilt.
i know it sounds stupid at first but in my defense i was on r/showerthoughts like 5 minutes ago.
so comparing the two sentences means you're comparing an accomplice to a non-violent crime who cooperated with the doj in convicting the person responsible to someone who put a woman in fear for her life and robbed a bank.

no, i think it's the dumbest show rt has ever made
i don't think forecasting that far into the future is certain enough for you to say that, even if we assume worst case warming scenarios.
you will likely need to do some nut work when going from 10s to 13s, and also considering you're going from a plain g to a wound one.
but as i've tried making logos for parkour related things before, i know this is not the easiest of jobs, you did really well!
i think he has a good chance of keeping it up.
but do i think the game is perfect?
let’s not also forget that they explicitly said they were releasing cds.

i'm curious of how a mink fur company tells someone to go vegan and fight against them instead of saying "don't worry it's humane/you name it".

every fisherman saying his fish was three feet long when it was one foot.
a feminist, presuming she's into dudes, is just as in to masculine, sexual, driven, self-motivated men as any other straight woman.
(his posts suggest he can't tell the difference between the two.)
the amount of upvotes this comment has received makes me think people who don't read tos deserve to get their data abused.
i hope he gets eaten by a grue.
this was a deliberate choice - you can say that it needs an overhaul, but don't pretend it was a mistake.
i thought it was pretty insightful but i really wanted to know if it was still relevant to dota2 as it was dota?
i thought it was actually something to do with mcdavid
but they are really good books i thought it was a little bad when the mc seems to be less useful than in the first but it is still interesting.
they said it was against the spirit of the secularism of the state and i would say that most of the province was in favor of that judgement.
i thought it was contrived and kinda bland.
i believe they operate like most other sites of the same sort, where users can upload their own videos.
what software do you think they use to make the still images/depictions you see in the games?
and if you didn't think anyone would notice the ratm influences then you must think we're deaf.
looking back, i realize i was part of the same organization and group of people that made me hate myself.
by internalizing these thoughts about humanity, i think i helped myself to gain a greater respect for people.
dude why didn't you let me know you were doing this!
something closer to the book with controllers for moving around and a room-scale setup similar to what we already have now with the vive are much more realistic, and i think it's a huge oversight that the movie omitted that detail.
i know i'm about to get 'murica but hear me out.
i couldn't find the prices of na coupes, i guess they're just too rare.
won once, and assuming we are talking "jackpot" here, the few bucks it cost won't even make a dent.
or at least i don't think it will be.
i guess you could call that a dry rain.
i remember i was looking through top commenters there from like 6 months ago, and you were on there a few times.
i dont even think we could possibly make enough moves this season to fix this pitching staff.
scent was fairly strong, considering it hasn't seen water yet.
let's say you wanted to filter all but your private network routes inbound from eigrp.
last i heard they now allow bct kids to drink dfac coffee.
and it's the second time i've heard this argument *today*, so i can tell it's from a talking point somewhere.
the more i think about it, the more i realize it’s just the eyebrows.
but i still don't think it's fair to say that our society just lets these kids do whatever without any consequence.
i think she is a keeper folks.
you’re correct, i believe they have an active exhaust that changes in volume based on drive mode
i know chester was writing about himself, but it resonated with me because i've felt this way since i was a teenager.
at first i thought that you were joking, but after watching a few videos i realize i really need a new gpu.
so we realized it's just better if she goes without me.
i hope there will be bonus tracks.
i don't think the idea is to create a strawman, but rather to illustrate that they are attempting to change the rules **mid-game**.
i know this isn't really related to nursing, but i would suggest getting a gmail account, it comes with a free drive that allows you to create/save/manage files online (word documents, excel, powerpoints etc).
googled it, found a guy on the duc forums saying he had the exact same issue, an avid employee said to try updating the ilok plugin manager application.
i’m assuming you mean things with direct medical implications.
i know i'm fairly average looking (maybe towards the higher end of average), so i never hate myself or have autoerotic fetishistic fantasies about myself either.
i wish i could get your retexture as a mod.
hillary's is low, but trump's is lower so that means trump is stumped.
seeing problems with the country doesn't mean you don't love it.
i can't remember the name but basically the idea was that we willed ourselves into existence i think it's called deism.
i think right now it's in a lot better condition.
i think they only have a couple of defaults set up right now, but i read somewhere that you can program exercises into it as you do them.
so i guess my advice is go practice being a human and try to, at the very least, make someone’s day no worse than it already is when you interact with them.
i mean you could try it if you want, but that sounds kinda weird to me.
maybe i just focus on little details, but i think many people really appreciate good editing.
...which is why i said he is much more like his wario land self
when you can say "i love you" in the group chat and everyone assumes you were talking to someone else.
i know it's weird :( couldn't find how to filter those results either
op said she will not stop her husband from doing it as that shits nasty
i just wish i could remember the music i made in my head, because if i had a way to translate those mental sounds into actual sides i'd have some pretty sick music.
i know it is petty, but it is constant joy to think that my neighborhood thugs handed yankee soldiers their own asses on the plate.
i think it's kind of both
i think a lot of people don't get the concept of edgy dark humor, but the point of it is to *make fun of* sexists and racists and bigots.
again, i was responding to op's claim that, as someone who lives in the area, he had heard this might be the case.
well, i suppose i should mention that i did not download an app, but rather i used a data recovery tool that involved connecting my phone to my pc.
i think it's still a minority though and more common amongst those who didn't go to college/university.
i'm all about the whole cyberpunk/hacker scene, and i'm assuming you might be going in that direction with this.
but i think the point of live disk is to test for drivers before you install it?
you'd think he'd figure out he was wrong.
wait i’ve seen you before
donald trump may think so, but once you are past i think it is 36 or 38 weeks, the baby is considered full term.
yes, that verse says he will be fine, so long as he is innocent.
i thought he was slated to return soon too
but i bet you if you start eating less meat, you'll soon eat none.
i hope that helps.
i believe that's called enlarged ventricles, am i right?
well, dingus, i think its pretty safe to assume he hasn't changed the default settings based on his question don't you?
not to mention that he was 17, so i believe he spent a year in juvy until he turns 18.
"*can you prove it's fake?
thought it was too good to have a ltm i could play in solo.
i seriously doubt it works in todays age of instant porn on the internet.
i think he's got way too much creative energy to waste his time remaking movies that don't need to be remade.
i ask and his friend says he has a cc up stairs but doesn't want to use it.
i think i'll be fine.
i guess ideally these would have separate timers but that allows players to burn through that content too quickly.
though if kenny decides he is going to go ham, mot many people can stop him.
i mean i even asked him if it offends him that russia is often even the bad guy in video games (like red alert for example) but no, nobody there gives a fuck.
i think they got banned from mine once people started stealing peoples full tubes, shaking them out while shouting "scramble!"
i wish i could view, in third person, me doing that to my mom at that age.
i see a lot of people running self care, and i'm okay with that in theory, but i'd be lying if i said it didn't bug me a bit when i see someone self-caring when i'm going to enter struggle state or die on the hook.
when did i say they were, exactly?
that means it would take 3 years alone just to finish the angiris council alone (imperius, malthael, itherael)
anybody who says u pitt and goes to pitt probably doesn't have friends
but i can put the victim on the stand and ask about how dark it was, and how scared he was, and didn't he say the attacker was wearing a hood that hid part of his face, and so on.
i assume you don't mean "it is you are problem" which is what you wrote.
the ambiguity cuts both ways: we can assume he means "i trust what the experts say," while iranian holocaust deniers can assume he means "the jury is still out on that."
realizing i forgot the i/o plate after i thought i was done.
i think he's good enough, but i'd rather not mess with what's worked well recently.
you don't think they'd cheat others out of elections, especially if they are looked at as a threat?
guess it took till now to realize that i don't value the org so much as i value the players.
i wish i wasn't so quick to jump on the exotic yesterday now.
what makes you say he thinks they're very fine people?
food for thought: at no point in the rhyme does it say he's an egg...
i suspect that "death grip" isn't nearly as common or as easy to develop as people think it is.
it can kinda bee forgiven in awakening since it's only on hard and above, and the edperience is always designed assuming you've played normal first and so are already familiar with each level.
it's not about bandwidth, i doubt you can get an internetconnection these days that doesn't have the bandwidth to support it.
i wish i had told her every reason she should lose weight, given she looked like 10lbs of shit in a 5lb bag, and was in no position to offer advice on aesthetics, but i just smiled and humoured her until she left.
i would argue this has nothing to do with culture and everything to do with biology.
i guess it depends on the people you play with.
i mean if you peruse old reddit threads, when people talked about the top clubs in europe, everyone said it was a trio of real, bayern, and barcelona.
meaning it's a bunch of these groupings of central hubs, all connected to the other groupings of central hubs.
i think we can all agree that the “ashamed to be indian” part is the cringey aspect of this.
i hope i can pull that one off.
between clammy and dry, peeling fingers, i don’t think i would ever have more than a string of 3 days in a row where touch id would work consistently.
i guess it never made it to n.y. or g.a.
assuming you haven't forgotten the first two rules, then the most effective one i can think of is "would you take a look at my computer?"
sounds good 'n all, and you might have the ability to look like david tennant, but i'd think you'd get bored having everything you wanted all the time.
yet we didn't rotate at all with that depth, and when we did we were knocked out first round of both domestic cups, and you think that's good enough?
that said i also hated it when the parents just kept walking and ignoring or shouting at them instead of asking them what's wrong.
and to suggest she is "being used" is a crock of shit.
i mean it's just humid and hot and nasty.
i get you have an aesthetic you're after, but a nice class d amp on a chip would fit in a similar casing just as well and sound significantly better with higher efficiency.
i totally know, understand, and wish those kind of calls didn't happen.
i will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're not a troll...what was her reaction?
maaaan, how i wish i'd realized that as a teenager!
the only mlm i think i've seen here is avon.
otherwise they want to gauge the potential usefulness / uselessness and how long they think it might take to max / comp again.
i think it could be because it's coming from your water heater which is pressurized and heats up the water stored in it.
i don't think you can have an overage if lesbians.
you guys are not stupid because of this just, truth be told i'm not sure what you are but know that you not stupid.
he would not have been as happy if he knew i was putting extra.
i think we could use a new midfielder or two, especially with christian berg gone, but i'm cautiously optimistic.
spurs org + fans have been asking for far more than what's actually reasonable at this point so i sincerely doubt anything fair will actually be discussed
i really hope there is a convenience store of some sort added soon.
i have a bit of an odd situation and am hoping you can help me.
i dunno, i grew up watching his movies and i think they're pretty kick-ass films.
i thought i was still young because i graduated from college like 4 months ago but apparently i'm old because i don't know what "lit" means
i wish i knew about the community services board before i worked here.
i know i was kidding
this is really misleading, and i agree it should say you can only use the benefit once per passage.
i'll guess we'll soon see if chris is still in the band or not.
i think it's just a product of the extensive history of the program.
i knew i did it wrong!
"crocodile suddenly has such strong armament haki that he can counteract doflamingo's " since a logia relies on avoiding damage by transforming, i'd assume most logia end up focusing on coo.
beyond that, saying they aren’t human raises a lot of implications about comatose, catatonic, or otherwise unresponsive adults.
note that i recommend you do this instead of `from pysolar.solar import *`, which is what the docs use.
i think i get what you are saying, but here's the thing: all this says you don't trust her (and really i still don't get the vibe that you respect her all that much either).
i mean honestly it sucks how annoyed it makes some people, since i was hoping it would be a mild inconvenience at worst, but other people *love* it so idk.
i think they serve a valid function as being a fast archer unit, but my problem is that they upgrade into a non-ranged unit, making their ranged promotions useless
and i think it is great games are made with diverse characters.
i know there have been questions about a lot of people claiming to be 100+ years old and some pretty solid proof that the "oldest person" french woman who claimed to be 124 when she died (or something like that) was probably not even close to 124.
i hope he has found peace.
i know you said you're a fan and so am i but the thread asked for boring and hot fuzz is not.
and assuming he doesn't elect to take a wage cut?
couple years ago, when wade was out of work, i thought the smartest move the packers could have made was to fire capers and hire wade.
i bet he likes to ask questions that have already been answered huh?
oh i see we're still on that wrong-think topic, despite events from last week.
it feels good to suggest that everyone in every shitty, low-demand, low-skill job in the world should make a "living wage," but the reality is that's not the case.
you realize those articles being linked are actually just ambiguous and being used to fallaciously discredit a person, right?
yea i didn't think it was bad at all.
** when your boyfriend finally grows enough of a spine to recognize that you hate him and believe he is inherently evil and nothing he can do will change that, he's going to leave, and then who will be your punching bag?
i think only yaya and modric are comparable, and i would argue that özil is better.
yes, of course, but it's rare enough that i'm assuming it's not what happened here.
he's a sell out who thought he was better than he was and now he's a nobody
https://youtu.be/-c-vszjqe6q if you're wondering how faithful it looks, the answer is 'more than i ever would have imagined it could.'
i think at this point it's safe to assume we'll never get magikarp&gt;goldeen for splash
i think it's a larger issue than just bayley but this is a great example of what i'm talking about.
it pays a little more and there's a "busy season" which means i work anywhere between 10 and 15 hours a day (with ot pay) and i couldn't be happier.
at first i thought it was a short loop
i also think it’s pretty weak to jump straight to fisticuffs in a non-self defense situation.
aliens listening to our broadcasts might think we nuked ourselves out of existence or went back to a primitive pre-tech state.
didn't realize there was so much involved, it actually gives me a newfound appreciation for the sport.
i hate breakfast (unless i go all out with eggs and everything) and am lazy but i know i should try it.
*having asked some friends if they have the sotg, they said they have gone from 20-50m xp dry doing what i am doing right now* **why do i want one?
i think it's mostly one sided.
i thought it was a discreet wide poetry contest like one that's not talked about but has a wide array of entries.
no i actually support the idea, i think our nations are far too small to compete with airlines and should take notes from sas/scandinavia
i'm hoping it'll break in with time but i've never seen usb keys or an audio jack so tight.
he walks in the door and realizes everything is gone - all the furniture, the dishes, every picture from the wall, all he sees is a broom and dustpan in one corner of a room.
come to find out, a few weeks/months beforehand, he learned his wife was cheating on him and it was hitting him really hard.
and the only part of the prophecy they left out is the part they didnt do, id imagine they didnt want to be tied to that ending when they could be subverting our expectations with rocks!
i thought control had a really strong start and i did enjoy his character arc, but as with everything, as the mystery surrounding him and area x unfolded i found it less satisfying than i was expecting.
i wish we could do couponing like this in the uk, most stores will only allow you to use one coupon per transaction and generally no multiples.
i don't think this was a decision he took lightly, and only made it with the goal of getting some of what he wanted done.
i think you mean n*ger.
i think it's worse when they tell you.
considering all the stories about the actor who played this guy and what he did to the guy playing the blue ranger, i don't think i'm comfortable with calling him a good guy...
similarly, what he's saying could mean he takes issue with the fact that he wants to implement a ubi \*or\* it could mean he takes issue with the methodology by which he plans to implement it (for instance he could not like how he plans to fund it, idk).
i’m glad to hear you don’t want to come here anymore because so far you’ve just been unpleasant.
i guess i should take off my fun fact that "i'm extremely liberal with my application of peanut butter"
i remember they did jaguar warriors in one of them.
so i didn't mean they're one and the same, but it's two sides of the same coin, which is putting a lot of time into a game to win more often.

besides, i don't think they would be that impressive anyway... [](/okay)
still i was reading the pi wasn't good for more then a 100am, because it has under spec usb ports.
look, i disagree with the right, but i think its important to have the decency to respect people's opinions.
i hope you never have the influence necessary to enforce this.
for the moline part, i can't say i've been to moline with fi yet, but next time i am out there, i will be sure to report my findinds
i could be wrong, and if your sister can verify there weren't coat hangers in those locations, then yes, they could be spiritual in nature
at first i thought you were siding with the pink guy.
hope it's the kontakt 5 iirc
i'm just confused what you thought you would find in /r/gtaglitches.
i guess this answers my question.
at least, i wish i could.
if you have enough, i imagine you'd be able to buy down dps.

dnc doesn’t have sole discretion, regardless how far in the cookie jar you think their hand is.

i am still laughing at you either way, and i could care less if you think i'm an actual nazi.
i think i'll call it the creeper-cute threshold.
drawbacks and consequences are part of the price to pay to get there, but if you support the happiness of every other human, regardless of race, and encourage integration, you can sleep well knowing you are on the side of good.
i know it’s those dates, but i know we get a specific appointment.
i actually think i saw a screenshot on one guy who was silver 2 and it looked like the new "end game scoreboard"

you can always claim you were driving to a safe area for you and the officer.

i agree it's not a big deal, but i also agree that it's big enough of one to warrant removal.
i suspect you probably could get away with it, if you weren't obvious and doing it in a low traffic area.
i think he'd just assumed that canada was like rural north dakota (or something).
the early 4s (through early 2014) had issues with the timing chain guides failing, but again i don't think the x3 had that motor until 2013.
just saying that i do believe they wanted the movie to be slightly funnier.
considering that you're effectively replacing a fighter - but without his hit dice or usual 16 con you could use the potential absorption of three hits (especially against enemies you know will most likely hit your ac with even mediocre rolls).
you could also check to see if there's an update to the creative software you're using, assuming that was installed separately from the drivers.
gotta remember you don't really have a hook either, can't exactly give her the d.
but i'm sure they could, with salary decreases, come somewhere close to the 40m they're saying they're losing, or more, could be found if they stopped paying top employees so much more than they're worth.

i don't know if we can assume that it was opened in '73, but we can probably assume that's around the time the original animatronics were made.
but that means if you're sending voice using udp, you better not lose any packets - voip/sip rfc papers spell out a tolerance of less than 1% packet loss.
it won't be easy to pull away from your habit of tv, and at first it'll be more difficult than i think you'd expect, but over time i think you'll find hobbies if you simply force yourself to try new things in your free time.
i personally think kratom has saved my life as i live in chronic pain and will absolutely not take any kind of opiate/opioid because i've seen them destroy too many friends and strangers.
i think some weapons need to use channeling in such a way that if you channel while using the weapon it gives said weapon a special effect or something.
now, where that person goes wrong - and i make this in my point above - is that they should have checked the itineraries of the two people in the article, realised they were still booked on flights in darwin, and contacted them as part of their investigation immediately.
i hope this comes form the federal level and not the provincial.
now that those antibiotic treatments failed, i am scared about the prospect of going up against what i have been told is a vicious treatment.
* does the item **lack** a unique model that may lead other to believe it should behave in a certain way (thunderfury, tarecgosa's rest, etc) if the answer to all of these questions is yes, you should be able to transmog the item.
all i know is he got a psych discharge shortly after, and they had to call in special cleaners to clean up the mess he left.
i think we need more than days.
he's already to a point where he'd probably throw a tantrum because you implied he was common.
just because a tomato is a fruit doesn't mean you use it in fruit salad.
an introvert doesn't go out his way to socialize, an extrovert does, but this shit:  means you lack the social skill set, that's it.
i applaud jordan's treatment of the palestinian people, and wish syria, lebanon, and egypt approached the crisis half as elegantly.
i thought this was one of the reasons cars have an idle air control valve.
i hope he does one punch man's new op next.
i don't think you understand this situation, it's a mental disorder, i also think that you should not make a joke about something unless you know what you are joking about, as in you know exactly how autism can affect a person, or if you yourself has that condition.
i doubt a world war is going to happen but a greater regional clusterfuxk is a distinct possibilty

i suggest you seriously re-evaluate how you argue.

that means the guys in their starting line-up are very good (after all, it's where all that free agent money is going), but it also means that they've skimped in terms of back-ups and reserves.
and then slowly but surely they'll warm up more i'm sure - i mean they won't have anything bad to say about you if you're doing all the right things.
but i’ve been lucky to have teachers who made an effort to show that there are multiple sides to every conflict in history and nobody ever believes they’re the bad guys.
i know you're not fine when you say you're fine.

i think chinander has more to prove than anybody else tbh.
get all of your grievances in writing, get them to accept these things are not ok and make it part of the snagging process.

it seems they're "rebooting" the black canary character.
the individual in question should have to demonstrate they are of sound mind, and at least two independent physicians should have to verify the patient's intent.

i think i read something on wikipedia that the game would show borginian text as an antipiracy measure, so maybe that's it.

i just wish he'd stuck around a little longer.
it's a pretty commonly accepted theory that is probably true considering they make costumes for him that embrace the meme, but they never said that they want him to stay bad.

i know it’s the daily “help” thread for questions, but i’m legitimately just trying to make arena easier for points.
i wish he'd review those neil young, ringo star, also rex orange county and king princess albums, but he'll probably just throw them in the yuno segment

i don't think that would work.
now i know steelseries has this for csgo and minecraft, but is that it?

i forgot i had it loaded, i was too angry to notice that
when i was that age a teacher told me that i didn't need to raise my hand so much because she knew i knew all the answers.

on the other hand i imagine there is some level of controversy in northern ireland but i know absolutely nothing about that.
i'm not a big fan of mustard, but just cause mustard isn't tasty for me doesn't mean it isn't a sauce.

don't forget the money spent making memory for it could be spent making more ddr4, bringing prices down on that as well.
as far as hormone imbalance, who's to say you weren't suffering from inexplicable bouts of frustration and rage?
do you think you can write any more bullets about your jobs?
because they still think it's funny?
it says i should not be able to run star trek online(which has more req then tf2) and it runs fine.
but doesn't that mean it should work on both?
i dunno, i used to be hyped for these debates, but now i don't think i'm going to be able to watch.

yeah but i think that one did not have widespread violence.
and eating too much fish that eats fish (not the one that eats algae) means you eat lots of mercury, because they have the summ of all the mercury of all the fish they have eaten in their life.
but otherwise, i think they'd just chase the guy down and bring him back.
at least 5 people knew that its what i wanted to do but some body fucking stole my idea and did it a few weeks before i was going to do it and no one believed it wasn't me.
i guess i can see where you're coming from.
i think you mean *gossip*.
i guess i should just go to the dmv tomorrow, get new stickers, and put them where they are visible.
i would like to think they are normal.
i believe it's called bouncer.
i'm guessing the next time we see anything gta v related will be at the vgas.
i don’t know i like how he immediately took the fight with edmund afterword.
i feel i should be shaking my leg like a dog.

i'm now realizing i don't watch enough educational shows about geography.
i hope you needn't think i'm crazy for flipping the final frontier to team blue.

i always try to do this, especially if it was difficult to set up -- just to show i appreciate that they're putting effort into the friendship, yaknow?
i think you should ask this in a week.
oh crap wrong sub, thought this was askreddit

i think he'll be a 3rd or 4th round pick.
i was in middle school in the early 2000s and didn't think gay people actually existed, and if they did it would be not more than a few thousand in the world.
4.0 buy a new mbp what do people think will get the best return for the money?
it's quite a stretch to say they look a like.
i thought i saw it in pasta padre but i can't find it now.
you know you could've done better for tepper, unc and emory though
i'm mostly with you, but i believe you're off regarding american fascists and jews.
real talk i think he should grow it out.
i never realised that was where the silk road guy got his username.
this makes no sense and makes me think you know nothing about basketball.

nor is it funny knowing there are so many adults out there who believe in fairy tales.
i don't think it's points related either i had a 51,000 point game a while back and it showed up on battlelog fine.
sucks for those of us with families as it means we're basically locked out of a number of career choices.
and assume i already have the main machine at home taken care of (it's another portable with a battery that won't hold a charge).
you know you've reached a special place in your life when *whatever* it is you said is made less creepy by directly stating "i jizzed on my phone."
i am not hyperbolic when i say that there are some red state politicans that would absolutely support throwing gay people off buildings if they thought it was any way politically viable for them.
i understand that's not always the case, but it was more likely and the actual case in this situation.
i simply believe they are misinformed.
it's why you think you're good at judging what others can afford *if only they managed their money better*
that pissed me off so much that charles and logan agreed to go anywhere with those people knowing it would certainly mean their deaths.

i guess you saved tonight
that's completely ignoring that is a parent's job to keep their kids from fucking up too bad, which means you may have to be active and nosy to do so.

she hopes surgery will help her mental health...
so i think we'll get less coercion overall.
people see that he doesn't average many points per game and think he sucks.
seriously, i get that we're like "yeah yeah loria sucks" but you're also pretty fucking stupid if you think a team's gonna seriously be like "yeah all tickets are 61% off."
lol, you mean we shouldn't try to normalize hassling over thousands of dollars of medical bills on the phone when we already pay a ton of money for monthly insurance to insurance companies who have workers that should theoretically do this job?
i've seen other people's say "disabled by add-ons" which i'm assuming means they have incompatible e10s add-ons but mine doesn't specify anything like this.

they said they tweaked the text a bit.
so you're saying you masturbate empirically?
demand they all be celibate.

i bet he doesn't even notice.
i think you are confused; i replied to a comment who linked an arabic word "peace" to "religion of peace" and that racist black man.
i believe the only reason i have gotten this far with c25k this time is because i keep my breathing regular.
your high school experience is unique and rare, and i say this as someone who feels he had a pretty good high school education.
i have to say you had a great priest there.

guess it's not available and all, at least here in the bay area.
no matter how crazy my life gets, i know you'll be there.
r* has already confirmed thicker automobile and pedestrian traffic, but do you think they would do something nice enough as to add hunting/animals to online play?
i mean i'm not spiritual in anyway whatsoever, but if i had to pick anything i would want to have a conversation with the g himself
i hope when forsythe comes back we dfa chase and keep taylor up.
my only narrative in posting this meme was i thought it was funny.
but since you think it doesn't, i know that you don't care about the danger; you're just looking for an excuse to not help people in need.
honestly i think anyone will be hard-pressed to convince me that not only were sherman's tactics necessary and effective, the man himself showed extraordinary discretion and (dare i say) mercy in what could've been (or was, according to southern propaganda, gone with the wind, etc.)
a lot of their dim sum don't come out as fresh and hot as you think they would.
the dumbest thing in the world is to say you're better than the next person while doing the exact same thing.
i know he met with them.
they were suggesting you get in the queue at noon.
oh you bet they did.
positive: it means you are good looking negative: it means that whoever called you it doesn’t think of you as tough or a roll up your sleeves kind of a guy.
check your contract to see if there's any part that says you can't do any reviews, or you need to contact him with questions, comments, concerns, complaints before any other actions.
just because something is "diet" or zero calories doesn't mean it is.
i don't think it is tbh
but not everybody knows the package is out-of-date and there has been some important bug fixes since, so i wanted to know if i could somehow inform the maintainer(s) since flagging it didn't do anything
i think we can both agree the real enemy here is edinboro.
ultimately, keep in mind, i'm not saying white is good.
i understand it won't disappear entirely, but i would assume having the lien in your past is a lot better than having an unpaid lien.
but people claim he's brain-dead.
i just think these are best used sparingly.
assuming he said yes?
doctors don't say you're over a condition until it's completely cured lol.
i'm not american but i think i once read (somewhere on the internet) that in the us, you're more likely to get asked for id than you might be in other countries, just to be on the safe side.
i think this is partially why it's generally considered such a bad idea to commit to a relationship soon after meeting someone.
think about it as two people wearing left-left and right-right 3d glasses (i mean both lenses are polarized in the same way and two different glasses).
i bet you've got a red line layered behind there somewhere
i'm sorry, i think you missed the point of this thread.
however, people automatically think i'm awesome at math, starcraft, computers, and love anime.
assuming i'm going to be taking over one of the initiates little rooms.
i think the series went in the right direction with audio tapes in gz.
** it's enough to make you feel you're losing your sanity in there.
i seriously hope you're trolling.
your mouth should say 'oops' or something else to reflect embarrassment, but your eyes should say 'you know you want some of this'.
well, that’s if you’re happy to call 45%+ of american voters a minority i mean, technically, in political terminology, yes, it’s a minority, but if you think it’s a minority along the same lines as, say, ethnic minorities, that’ll be a lie.
this game could be huge on ps4 with 70k people playing at peak compared to just 2k on pc, i just hope the new players stick around and aren't all put of by these problems which hopefully can be ironed out.
the only game i've had problems with in windows 8 was with minecraft but it's no surprise considering it is already glitchy as hell

i guess it's much to ask, but if someone could translate it or at least give some context, i'd much appreciate it.
ahhh i wish they could improve it as the world cup progressed.
i was being facetious to demonstrate that i might as well say you lose vibrations by spitting, since similarly to op's claims, there is no explanation of the mechanism of how this is supposed to happen or even what it's supposed to mean.
how else do you think they made the ticket prices 'cheaper'
in america, we're raised to think it's okay to scream at people and flip them off for any perceived sleight involving automobiles.
in any case, i think you won't regret the clear switches.
if you ramble things will come out of your mouth you do not mean to say, or believe, and they will use anything they can against you to say you are lying...so breathe deeply and if you do not know or are unsure you say that.
i think i remember the wording being no new pov chapters from unknown characters ala areo hotah, instead taking established charts acted as needed
unluckily (luckily), i got laid off around the holidays and decided it was time to reassess myself and what i wanted.
either case implies he thinks that her breaking up with op was the right call.
other commentators apparently think that approach means i'm some pinko commie who thinks we live in a utopia.

i think this is hilarious and would watch for the shocked responses the first couple times.
i think they might have had fruit "teas" as well.
maybe this is a genetic and indicates you are descended from a conquistador.
if you think it's a one-sided deal then you're either ignorant or stupid.
i envy your budget is about the only thing i can say.
so while i wish i could have transitioned earlier, i’m really happy with where i am now.
my understanding is the sweetness of macrobrews is a direct result of people making bathtub hooch during prohibition.
they may as well be producing extras for movies, i bet the walking dead needs them a lot.
actually, now that i think about it, i think i might want champ instead of browner.
i don't think i'll ever agree with there being a right amount of lesbians.
my dad supports me in this because he also wanted to get a motorcycle license, but so far a lot of people say it's a bad idea.

i think you'll be good then

as a former utah native i'd say you would be fine with flip flops.
when did i say bernie bros was limited to white males?
the pain was a lot worse in her left ear, which is why i believe it's associated with the old injury.

i hope you not only intellectually accept that but emotionally accept it at some point soon.
i find it hard to believe women are not checking out guys asses and muscles and package.
i knew it would not be wise to have any type of physical relationship with a room mate and we agreed on this at the beginning of living together.
it's not that i don't like them, it's that i can already tell i'm not going to relate to that person.
i never liked the quiet shy type very much, all though i will say i think sumia did it miles better than sakura.
fundamentally, there is no body that gravity is "emitted" from, and it's counterproductive to understanding to say there is.
are you saying i can brand my foes with my mark on the go?!
the argument for maf is he's a skilled veteran to handle the transition into that window while gillis/paraons/rittich develop.
if they were all wrong then, why are you assuming they're right now?
anyway, i don't think you'll be able to tell if you'd like the game from a video, since i'm not considering most of the things you're interested in and instead looking at the psychological nature of the gameplay, so i'd say download the demo and try it yourself!
who said you were doing the forcing?
i realize i didn't make it clear enough when a few people mentioned schizophrenia.
i think with trump we also realized that there are wide swaths of people out there who held their noses or stayed home when romney/bush/mccain was standing up there talking about not regulating the "job creators" and flaunting their wealthy, connected backgrounds.
i understand it would be up to the individual, but if i attempted to get a foreclosed home, would the bank accept?
half way through the episode i concluded it was a show about absolutely terrible people, getting away with being absolutely terrible people, while somehow attempting to operate on some sort of moral high ground.
i won't ruin it, but let's just say i yelled "are you fucking serious?"
major nelson at xbox has said its up to the games publisher to give microsoft the green light.
just because it's digital doesn't mean it lacks value.
why do you think it shot up to $150?
i guess it's because about half the year it's freezing outside, so people can't really dry their clothes in their gardens (and people in apartment buildings don't have gardens).
the police claim it's gang related.
i think its interesting that you like the scarab section in "metropolis" from halo 2, because the developers themselves actually loathe it due to it being way too scripted
i'd have to look to be sure, but i'd wager they're still just .lnk files in the user's start menu in %appdata%...
as a non-expert, i think you'll be fine.
people, especially bad parents, get quite defensive when you try to discipline their kids and they probably don't feel you are old enough to be doing that.
i suppose it would be similar to pointing a house at a speck of dust.
i think they got the wrong poster.
this video clearly shows you need a space that has the length of a car plus half a length!
i cannot believe she is 23 years old.
i am nearly 20 now and they haven’t apologized for what they did, in fact, i don’t even think that they believe they did anything wrong.
i think it looks awesome.
let's hope that you post on your 6th cake day will be telling us how you love your job, your life and how you have aspired others to embrace life following your post on your 5th cake day.
i swear i could build her at least three more times if i cared to.

i can’t believe i’ve never been here before
i guess i really showed it.
reaching a milestone like that should be "hey, thanks for reliably bringing people back to our site and selling ads" not "hey you now have our permission to buy this sign that says you're cool".
i just thought it was some kind of pron with over the top acting centred around some kind of horror plot.
i notice you didn't specify tv show.
don't smoke just thought you guys might like it.
wish i could find that website i was reading.
i mentioned that he left out "of the people", and suggested he do some reading on the national firearms act, gun control act, and fopa before making inaccurate statements.
i think it would be cumbersome to try and get the audience to know that you were labeling the armor as something as well as labeling the character as something else.
i think i just read this a second ago, same syntax and everything
they weren’t as super friendly as they were in amsterdam, but i didn’t think they were any lees friendly than people in any other huge western city.

guess you can never be too prepared for a new year
i bet you're a millennial mark
guess you didn't like chrono trigger (multiple endings) or ffvi (multiple story lines)...
guessing that it took this series for people to realize the maps were circular, i guess the game was too pretty to look at it's problems.
that sounds ridiculous and i doubt there is actually legal backing that says you can.
i mean they said they werent going to add new heroes until after ti4
i really wish we had a fallout game based imac but that would just be new vegas but with a boardwalk
and i don't think it was bdf.

she then used her phone to again photograph her computer monitor while said facebook post was in her browser window.
i think you have to live here to know what i'm talking about.
no worries, i hope you're able to find language snippets!
unless you're watching sports or something where you feel you *have* to watch it live and couldn't put it off for 15 minutes so you can skip the adverts.
i don't think you should be able to live independently from it.
i thought wallis was close to montreaux where they have the huge music festival.
your title says you were held hostage for two days...but you went to work and attempted to go to the police station, yet you instead went back to the gangsters house of your own volition.
light went green and we all shot off, i got to about 20mph, looked to my right and see the guy in the grom was just about there.
i picked out the guy i thought it was and interestingly he was found just blocks away at a bus stop, with some grass stains on his white shoes etc.
i guess it would be showing people a php proxy to get around a content blocker.
i think i heard the russo brothers were saying one of the reasons hulk didn’t come out after thanos (besides the beat down) was that he felt under appreciated and that they only let him out when they needed something to smash.
i like the whole scavenging for everything you have, gives me a feeling of having earnt everything but i guess it isn't for everything.

i guess the sex is still tolerated though.
the waaay too much emphasis on religion : i know i said that i like that some people like their religion but some people like it too much.
when i play on the us servers (i'm in the uk), which i do most of the time, i do notice that i'll sometimes lose a 1 on 1 gunfight when i feel i should have won it.
they say i have to come off the bench!"
i disagree that we'll see a new smash, chances are we'll probably see a port of the wii u version with maybe new dlc and all existing dlc.
mauro said he took up bjj in 1998, which meant he was 21 at the time.
my point was i like the challenge more than the difficulty of getting good loot.
i think i've heard babcock say that he puts them on the fourth line to loosen them up and find their confidence again when they aren't on their game.
i hope it has been the ink.
but he's also hiding out of shame for how badly he feels he screwed up: he's not ready to go and face kylo ren again, he's still not good enough, and he's convinced that if he tries to bring the jedi back again now he'll just fail again.
i'd imagine i'd feel the same way if we could've has children the relatively free way, because it's not like i'd be able to carry baby/ies for her.
then again, maybe they think they're doctors.
there's your mbp to consider as well, as i assume it would still be serviceable for portable use.
im not sure how the one you're trying is, and don't throw away $20 on my account, but i think i would recommend trying fantasy any sport at least once just for the experience.
i think you're seriously exaggerating about either the frequency of those salaries, or the amount.
same reason buskers throw a couple of bucks in their guitar case... so that people see they're taking donations and see that 'others' gave bills instead of change.
we'll say it's once a week, or imply it's very vanilla porn not containing anything our girlfriends wouldn't do.

everyone seems to like his new album, but i think its mediocre at best.

one would think losing weight would do the trick for sure
wtf another post the other day said it was a painting...
i voted for him the first time because he barely mentioned gun control (i know he mentioned it but it was basically in passing) and he promised to close gitmo and do something about the patriot act and institute universal healthcare.
right which goes along with him being a catfish... just cause he’s messaging someone online doesn’t mean he’s necessarily done what he claims - either way, the most you can do is report it

junior lol, i was born in 94 so i dont have much memory of the guy, but i've been told a lot of people wanted him to run for president.

i just think you are weirdly misreading the obituary if you did in fact read it, and your headline is completely insane.
i hope they can back to the place they used to be.
i mean it's like; there *has* to be something because being aware of absolute nothing seems impossible, but at the same time being unaware of it just seems weird and confusing.
i'm not saying it's decidedly not red bulls issue, but it must be noted that red bull consistently finishes top six and thus probably uses the engine more intensively than the midfield and backmarker teams with renault.
or i would imagine it is, anyway.
"i think it's wonderful.

my son comes running when he realizes i'm peeing, hangs on to my leg, and peers around to watch the stream.
i havent had any either...i kinda wish they would so i could get a new co detector.
agreed, i was getting pretty worried about the center back situation but actually seeing the squad list i think it's manageable.
but i think bugs play a major part in games like this as they allow crafty players to use them.
i was thinking it would suck to be the guy down below because the other guys ass is in his face.
you mean that there are all kinds of different people with all kinds of different opinions and just because someone holds one opinion about one issue doesn't mean they hold an entire belief system?
how about you quote the law that says it is a crime.

i'm thinking i could use him for yamato, maybe
i like peanut butter and i like jam, i just don't think they should be mixed.
here it is straight from the state constitution:  of course, this is unconstitutional, and i can almost guarantee a few state reps/senators (particularly from austin) are devout atheists (not exactly the right words, but good enough).

kirito said he killed two, but it was never stated if asuna killed anyone.

and sure, you can treat infected prisoners with no medicine, but that's going to require that you sit there waiting for prisoners to get infected, then hope the prisoner doesn't die - if they do, that's a pretty big mood penalty for the colony.
i thought that was kaitlin bennett, unless they both did it.
oh, so are you suggesting tom hanks should play batman?
probably figured it was dysfunctional enough to get easily cut.
you don't think it's offbeat for the *president* to cyberbully journalists?
here they go through what was required of the hearing to find the guy guilty, and they decided he wasn't, and then upheald it on appeal.

in case you haven't notice all dot com companies **including amazon** do not pay income tax already.
it was so awkward because everybody would nod and listen because shes the boss, and she'd take that to mean she had a receptive audience and tell her about all the cool dreams she had that came true, blah blah.

as an ed nurse i think i'm a little better, but don't think i'm a paramedic by any means.
i thought the content of the page "the page [you're] looking for does not exist... perhaps searching will help" was a reference to when obi wan was looking for kamino and that youngling helps him realize to find it he just has to go where he thinks it is.

i don't think the softs should last almost twice as much as the super softs.
meanwhile, with nia i think it is very important to note a few scenes.
cause the author put it under round 8, i thought he took it out in round 8.
considering neither my boyfriend nor myself have any chance of getting pregnant, i don’t think i’d need it.
i thought it was going to be a tree, but it wasn't.
i know you will be waiting for me to get back so you can rape me again, but maybe next time i will enjoy the challenge.
mormons are farther from christians in the ways i've mentioned before, still, most people correctly assign them as christians, other christians who feel they are dangerous/silly heretics notwithstanding.
i never seemed to have a problem with the rings i personally think it looks cooler the old way but if there is a technical reason i would like to know what it is
stop guessing, define what the definition of moron is then do a study if you believe that’s true and come back with the results.
oh yeah i remember at my old school they banned them because they thought kids would get scared
what evil spirit possessed you into thinking milk in a keurig was a good idea?

i guess they weren’t computer programmers.
kerr said he'd like to have the players coach multiple times this year.
i've never really thought about it much but i suppose the respawning happens when i know i'm dreaming (which is most of the time) because i know that i'm not actually dieing so the shock doesn't wake me up.
i rather thought the pertinent question was 'if'.
i can't believe i never went out in the rain before.

i think beating civ 6 could be defined as filling out the hall of fame or getting every achievement.

i think they both play differently and really the cent is either a bit op out the stryker needs a buff.
referring to the guy as a "fucker" is normal when you think you are in private with colleagues.
i figured someone else would jump in and add a similar comment referencing one of the other *numerous* red flags he listed.
a lot of people hate wickd, because they think he's just "pretending to be nice".
he thought it would be better over the long term, but it is actually worse over the long term.
but i promise i'll respond.
he hasn't made a crack about me being action packed with issues in a long time, though i suspect it's partially because i pointed out he's got more issues than i do... come to think of it, it's that kind of long-time-coming realization that really works to make him stop.
i think your comment is intending to make two points: 1) guns have had their current destructive potential for a long time.
i hear they were still coming through.
i don't think he would have gone that far but i never trusted him.
breaking encryption like that (assuming they're all using decent encryption, which probably) is ludicrously tough.
a plan not succeeding doesn't mean it was a bad plan.

i like what he brings to the team as an excellent fielder and potentially useful bowler and just wish he would just up the ante when required and make a daddy hundred
so i'm going to assume he's not.
i think it's a bit odd that caravans take so much more time than it would take colonists to cross an equivalent space if zoomed in.
i mean i can’t say the mans is gonna smash because his girl nice...but then again...maybe.
he asked if she had "relapsed into puberty" then ***suggested they get a new nana*** nobody replaces nana
in their defense, nobody knew tampa was going to be this bad in week 2.
well, now that that's over i guess we can really decide things in the playoffs....  oh....my bad.
heck i've come into work a couple times without making any changes and i've had to re-activate because windows forgot it was activated.
not a biker but i would say a law change would be dangerous as hell for you guys.
i think you are really underestimating the inconvenience of an unwanted boner.
the pastor stopped and i asked what was wrong, she said i'm sorry but all i can think of is your father saying whichever of us dies first the other has to dance the irish jig around their grave and get drunk.
while i understand the desire for revenge i really don't think it would be healthy for him to think that way.
i'm not saying all guns should be taken from everyone; i'm saying that we should ensure that the people who do buy them have to take a gun safety class, have to pass stringent background checks, and should have to register the firearm akin to registering a car title.
i guess i just liked the aesthetic and hope to see it transfer into the main game.
so are you saying i pretend to be against the astroturfers taking advantage of unpaid inadvertant proletariats shilling for them?
the fact that odb went so high off of just yards makes me feel he is a solidified wr2.
normally i think he could get away with it but having 3 employees, 4 presumably with stubbs have accidents in a short time frame would look suspicious to anyone.
while it is generally understood that you run on the left and bike and drive on the right, i would argue that it is actually safest to run on the right side of the road assuming there is a sidewalk and not just an empty shoulder.
nah, i think i'll keep it up.

i was confused and then realized i had left the pizza on the trunk.
he blocked me on ig cause i proved he stole a meme from my friend.
she said she does it because i want to do it.
he comes dangerous close to hitting some rock, and for a second, you legitimately believe he got hit.

i think he is picked enough as he is..
no, i don't think he does.
i think it's odd that the makers of the game could grossly misunderstand the essence of the fucking game they're making, even though it has more than one template to base itself off.
but i don't think it's to the same extent as in ratman.
lol, at what point did i say i need or want it?
aang explained that they were using that knowledge to prevent the fire nation from taking over the world and he still thought it was a misuse of it.
never said they weren't; this is actually what i meant by "raid-like redundancy".
she's entitled to think it looks better; as you said, any adult who wants to get his self circumcised is free to do so.
gonna say this might be more than *mildly* vandalized.
i don't remember how young i was, but i know i was younger than 7.
actually, i don't think we've ever seen a "well-rested" stannis.
i'm going to assume it was a drunken purchase.
in my interactions with others, i try to live by, "assume they're doing the best they can."
i know there were a few early special screenings for some sort of film type they used to film the movie.
i'm not recommending you do, just wondering whether there might be ramifications if "someone" did so.
in the end, i got everything to my own place and did want i wanted with them.
i laugh at them internally and hope that one day they realize they are wasting their lives on a trend.
i didn't realise it was popular and beautiful, so when i got it i was like "ah another useless skin that won't affect my gameplay".
secondly, there are about a bazillion oils and liquids in a car (if you think i'm joking, there are more than 10).
don't you feel it receiving slow, soft neck massages?
the person before was more of a, "we're familiar and we are probably settling" situation, and i knew i was sacrificing a lot being with him.
the most confusing part for me was he’s saying “okay this is a good starting point” as if he didn’t realize that he *had to respond or counter in order to get to the next point*

i sort of think we should allow one person per month to swing at them with a sledgehammer.
furthermore, i *explicitly* said i'm not saying we should abolish welfare.
or is it because the jobs see i had a previous security clearance and so its easier to re obtain one?
i guess she doesn't know how tickets work
back when netflix was being throttled, level 3 called out comcast as being at fault, saying all they had to do was run a bit of fiber from one port to another and the problem would be solved.
so you grow up from 10-18 and the day you turn 18 you say "fuck it, i'm leaving to go back to a shit country because that's what the law says i have to do?"
i heard it was made in china, everything is good from china.

just because you can sometimes survive savini doesn't mean he isn't op.
that's why i think it's a counterfeiter.
how do you know they happened?
i hope they nab his ass, though.
even if you think you do, you don't, and probably never will.
cause i could forever say i punching him in the face and got away with it.
in my state, even if you blow zeros on the machine but the cop thinks you are drunk/high/whatever, they'll just take you to the hospital for a blood draw and that is where you get fucked.
my age might be showing, but i think i remember them reading excerpts from this on mancow.
while that might work for a small segment of society, i really think it's setting yourself up for failure.
just cause we don't want to watch it doesn't mean the pimple rights activists are inherently right edit: what are you downvoting?
i think you are right that it is being mindful of what you eat.
question, which i generally found to be one of the more confusing aspects of buying...with that one i think it's more of a rule-of-thumb, it's not necessarily a follows b follows c.
as a successful, fit, well-traveled nerd married to a hottie, i’ll say i’m proud to be one.

does jaden smith know you're hacking his twitter?
i never said it would succeed.
i don't know man, i guess we just look at it differently.
i think we do agree.
i actually think he is really fluid in movement, his 2014 &amp; early '15 play has him stick to receivers like glue in man coverage.
but i think you will eventually be quite at peace with your decision.
you say “the waiter” when i believe you mean 90’s alternative rock icon ed kawalzcdjwjfxn.
just realized this is front page because the irony was pointed out by emma watson
is your very "metcore-by-numbers" drumming style a conscious decision by the whole band to make your music easily consumable by casual metalcore listeners or do you guys recognize that your drummer is trash and wish you had a competent one?
i was in the same boat as you: saw it shortly after it first came out (when i was 18 or 19), didn't quite "get it," but recently re-watched it and thought it was a lot better.
i don't tell her when i have to work super early or late, but when i know she's swarmed, i sneak in and help her with some of her school papers.
you think they do the slug bug game too?
don't worry i just stole it.
the only reason we know his name is because they filmed him chopping heads while speaking in a british accent instead of stereotypical arabic, and some media outlets decided he would make a good villain de jour.
i hope it gets a lot of support on the development part too.
there are two teslas in our household [2013 model s &amp; 2018 model 3] and my mom genuinely prefers a toyota rav 4 which is literally the most insane viewpoint i've ever heard it takes gas and has gears and shit.
i haven't played much besides bc2 (i'm not much of a hardcore gamer, and even less so an fps fan), but i think that's the general idea behind the battlefield series.
are you saying training to run at a faster pace for a certain distance is the same as training to run longer distances?
oh i thought you were trying to say you could concentrate well when you had multiple tasks.
but then again i also fake being sick most sundays, so maybe they decided it'd be pointless or something.
on closer examination, i think you're right.

why'd he raise his hand, look over and realize he was raising the wrong hand?
i'm not gonna assume something is sarcastic it's in a serious political sub and doesn't have a /s
they are fucking terrifying you know it's a bad storm then the raid sirens go off and you just run to a basement as fast as your legs can carry you.
i say this since you mentioned "kids these days" and want to show i'm not.
just because she had an "in" doesn't mean she was manufactured.
that said, i think the current f1 cars should have more power.
because she thinks she can still reason with them or talk them down.
i know it's possible in the nrtherlsnds, but it's insanely expensive.
but if you don't give them a job of some kind, they'll decide the job is to run the household for sure.

i see you're reading nice guys of america's piss poor ways to form a meaningful relationship with another human being.
i would think he is referring mainly to people who've never played the game praising it.
he probably knows killing is a bad thing and is ashamed doing this in front of his dad.
i think we all can agree that there's too many people ranting about the show, and of course those who use the "monty card" are straight up idiots.
i mean i have something awkward happen to me every day, so this isn’t exactly revolutionary.
plus how is it fair to anyone if lets say they log in at 5pm and have to wait in a queue for 2 hours while their counterparts at getting in after only 5 minutes of waiting at the same time.
i think you got that one wrong.
i guess i'm just going off anecdotes.

most people are not doing any research, they just eat what they feel they should.
i thought you had the bad result.
i don't have the proper equipment to take accurate noise level measurements, but would wager it's about 30-35db tops, but probably lower and just accentuated by our brain's ability to pick up on single frequencies.
i know i can just not do that, but i just feel like it would be better to play as the characters gearbox made and not some random items mashed together.
i know santa doesn't exist, and i will claim that he doesn't exist without qualifiers.
the entire memo is just vincent saying that he thinks drug use is wrong and elaborating on what he would do to players that used them in a hypothetical world where he had any power over the situation.
the general thought is that most parents who think it is normal or even necessary to use pain as a parenting instrument are victims of shitty upbringing themselves.

i’d like to say he would win if he stuck to the game plan, but at hw all it takes is one good shot to turn the tide.
but i shouldn't say "i think homosexuality is gross, and anyone who is gay is disgusting."

i guess it's possible it's genetic or something.
ive always heard they were inaccurate and impossible to control, i have no clue how that can be when this guy apparently had no firearms experience and killed and wounded hundreds.

i am not saying you should not tweet but with how big the smash scene is getting everyone should be careful.
it's not bad, but i honestly think s&amp;y is better for him since it gives him more bulk and speed.
thought you or someone else might be interested in doing the same, but haven't yet because of the fear of putting a voice-controlled speaker outside of your walls.
i don't think it's even arguable, the hm bonuses in binding blade made those characters so much better than every other unit it was absurd.

while it's obvious that lotad was shiny during the research event, i figure there's no harm in confirming that it's still shiny, i found this lotad in the wild the day after the event.
keynesianism thinks they can cancel speculative bubbles out.
i know it's clean.
i thought it was pronounced like "book."
i think it's hilarious how they give no fucks.
i mean i agree that it is very suspicious, but cosby is a big target and you can't rule out the possibility (though seemingly improbable) that he is innocent.
with canadian tax, union dues, and pension that means i took home about $35000 a year maybe.
