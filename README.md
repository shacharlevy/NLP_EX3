Natural Language Processing â€“ Assignment #3
Project Description
This assignment focuses on syntactic parsing and linguistic investigation, specifically examining the usage and omission of the word "that" as a subordinate conjunction in informal writing.


Task Overview
Task #1: Analysis of "That" as a Subordinate Conjunction
In English, the word "that" can function as a connector between a main clause and a subordinate clause. For example:

Explicit Usage: "The authors thought [that] they should continue working on the project." Here, "that" is used to connect the clauses and is optional.

Implicit Usage: "She hopes [that] surgery will help her mental health." In this case, "that" is implied but not explicitly stated.

Your task is to investigate the phenomenon of "that" omission by analyzing sentences collected from Reddit. You need to:

Identify Explicit Sentences: Locate sentences where "that" explicitly connects a main clause to a subordinate clause.
Identify Implicit Sentences: Find sentences where "that" could be used but is omitted, following a verb.

Examples:


Explicit Usage Examples:

"When someone in the audience asked about it, he explained that it was his day job."
"Guess it took till now to realize that I don't value the org so much as I value the players."
"We don't know that he actually died though."


Implicit Usage Examples:

"She hopes [that] surgery will help her mental health..."
"Guess [that] it took till now to realize that I don't value the org so much as I value the players."
"Doesn't seem like he knows [that] it's wrong."
Sentences where "that" is not following a verb, or serves other syntactic functions, are out of scope for this task:

"I hypothetically have never heard of that fallacy before."
"The book that my sister recommended was excellent."
Implementation
You are provided with two files:




config.json: Contains input and output file locations.
main.py: Contains code that should not be modified.
Your task is to implement the function:



python
Copy code
def identify_explicit_and_implicit_that_clauses(filename):
    ...
    return set(), set()
Implementation Details
Verb Precedent: Consider only cases where "that" is directly preceded by a single-word verb. Phrasal verbs and other variations are not included.
Sentence Uniqueness: If a sentence contains multiple instances of "that," only consider the sentence once. The function should return sets of sentences.
Parser Usage: Utilize the Self-Attentive Parser with the benepar_en3 English model. You may use either the version integrated into spaCy or directly work with NLTK Tree objects.
Goals: Aim to identify approximately 1000 explicit and 1500 implicit sentences out of a 10,000 sentence dataset. This is considered a reasonable achievement.
Exploration: Use the SelectKBest function from Assignment #2 to find distinguishing words between the two sets of identified sentences. Analyze and reflect on the markers and tendencies of "that" usage or omission. Include your reflections in the submission document.
Runtime: Ensure that your code executes within 10 minutes.
Deliverables
Document: Provide answers to the task, including reflections on the exploration.
Code Submission: Include your code in the version submitted, but do not invoke it in the final version.
Running the Code
Setup: Install the required parser and dependencies.
Implementation: Implement the function identify_explicit_and_implicit_that_clauses as described.
Execution: Ensure the code runs efficiently and adheres to the runtime constraint.
